# Pomodoro Timer

Simple timer app that follows the Pomodoro productivity technique.

## Main features

- Work sessions and short/long break sessions.
- Countdown timer for each phase.
- Labels showing the current session and completed pomodoros.
- Start and reset buttons in a Tkinter window.

## What I learned

- Using Tkinter to build a basic timer UI.
- The `after()` method for scheduled callbacks.
- Managing state across different timer phases.

## How to run

Open `main.py` in Python 3 and run the file.
